Alder Lake laptop - Laptop is *FAST* because of the 32GB ram although
seems somewhat underpowered CPU.

Able to install Linux - Wifi works.  Audio seems to have issues but
reports of kernel fixes

Can't seem to charge with USB-C port.

Big issue is screens.  The work although they seem to be inverted.
Setting up xandr and adding a monitor configuration works, for X
applications.  Causes headaches for GDM which doesn't use X
configurations.  Adding video config to grub causes screen to be
correctly oriented but causes mouse to go upside down.

xandr causes everything to work.  Screens do not turn off
automatically when lid is closed, but xrandr fixes that.

Touch screen seems to have orientation issues.  Screen seems to
respond but need to fix orientation.
